# Meetup Night-of Workflow

A lot goes into facilitating the meetup. Here are the various activities that occur on the day of.

## What you will need

* Access to the **PyTexas Meetup Google Drive**
* **PyTexas Meetup Organizer** role in **Discord**.

## Events

### More than an hour before the meetup

* Confirm with the other organizers who is performing what role. While the meetup can be run with a single host only,
  we prefer to have 1-2 [hosts](../roles/host.md) (so that there can be banter), and 1-3 
  [backstage](../roles/backstage.md).
* Check the [run-of-show document](../runbooks/create-run-of-show.md) and ensure that the upcoming community meetup 
  information is complete and accurate.
* Ensure that the speaker is confirmed to be available an hour before the meetup for an AV check.

### An hour before the meetup

* Start the `test` stage and meet with the speaker for AV check. It is encouraged that any available host and backstage
  staff attend. During the AV check, the following things should check:
  * Check that the the speaker is audible.
  * Check that the speaker is able to share video.
  * Check that the speaker is able to share their content.
  * Check that the speaker is familiar with the Discord UI, and know how to access the chat and share options.
  * Check that the hosts and backstage have links and access to the content, as a backup.
  * Talk the speaker through the run of show and answer any questions.
  * Get any preferences that the speaker has on how questions and feedback will be delivered.
  * Capture how the speaker would like to be introduced, including name pronounciation, preferred gender, and bio.

### Thirty minutes before the meetup

* Start up the chat in the `meetup-discussions` audio channel.
* Post to the `announcements` channel with an `@everyone` tag to say that the meetup is starting in 30 minutes and that
  the meetup pre-chat has begun.
* Keep the chat going. Ensure we welcome anyone who joins, and encourage them to join in as they wish.

### At meetup start

* Start the event in Discord, which should open the stage and send a message with `@everyone`.
* Follow the [run of show document](../runbooks/create-run-of-show.md)

### After the meetup

* Start up the chat in the `meetup-discussions` audio channel.
