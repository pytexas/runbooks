Talks for the meetup probably should have some sort of wide    appeal, and definitely MUST follow the code of conduct guidelines.</li> <li>Does it feel like this topic could be adequately covered in 30-60 minutes? Talks shorter than 30 minutes might    need to be combined with another shorter talk to make a sufficient meetup out of. Talks longer than 60 minutes   run the risk of a lot of attendence drop-off.</li> <li>Does the submission give you the impression that the speaker can cover the topic? This might be very hard from    to tell from just the submission, but if you have any concern, it may be a good idea to reach out to the speaker    with some questions.</li> <li>Does the submission feel like its goal is advertise a paid product? If so, we may not want to approve it. The   dividing line comes down to the \"primary purpose\" of the talk. If it feels like the main goal is to illustrate    some language feature, technique, pattern, library, or something else; and happens to use a paid product, then it   is probably fine. If it feels like the focus of the talk is the paid product, then it is probably not fine.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Assuming the talk has not been rejected, identify a month for the speaker to present in.</li> <li>Contact the speaker and confirm that they are available to speak during the selected month.
